### Professional README Generator

### Project Description
This project is a Node.js Challenge to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from the userâ€™s input. The application utilizes the Inquirer package to prompt the user with questions and compiles a structured, professional README based on the user's responses. The generated README includes sections such as the project title, description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, contribution details, test instructions, and more.

By using this tool, developers can quickly generate high-quality documentation for their projects, following the best practices outlined in the Professional README Guide.
